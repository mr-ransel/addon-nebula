# addon-nebula
Home Assistant addon for [slackhq/nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula)

There's always more development to go, but as far as my use cases go it appears fully functional. Open an issue if you find a bug or something it's unable to support from nebula.

In particular the documentation on configuration options could use improvement, but I promise they're at least all there to be found.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on store**.
2. Click the three dot menu on the top right corner

4. Return to the **Add-on store***
5. Find the "Nebula" add-on and click it.
